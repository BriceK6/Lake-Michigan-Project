## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r import}
library(readr)
GLOS_data_export_45161 <- read_csv("GLOS_data_export_45161.csv", skip = 1)
lake <- GLOS_data_export_45161
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(lubridate)

```

Here are "ideal" surfing conditions for somewhere like Maui or California. These condititions are very rare in Michigan. We take any waves.
```{r ideal surfing conditions}
wavewind <- lake %>%
  select(date_time, wind_speed, wave_height, wind_direction, wave_direction, month_date, year_date ) %>%
  filter(wind_speed >= 0 & wind_speed < 150, wave_height >= 0 & wave_height < 30, wind_direction >= 0 & wind_direction <= 360, wave_direction >=0 & wave_direction <= 360) %>%
  arrange(date_time)

surfIdeal <- wavewind %>%
  filter(wind_speed > 0 & wind_speed < 10, wave_height >= 2.5 & wave_height < 300)%>%
  arrange(desc(wave_height))
  
surfIdeal %>%  
  summarize(meanWave = mean(wave_height), minWave = min(wave_height),
            maxWave = max(wave_height), meanWind = mean(wind_speed),
            minWind = min(wind_speed), maxWind = min(wind_speed), count =  count(surfIdeal))
  
surfIdeal %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = wind_speed, y = wave_height))+
  geom_point(size = .5)+
  labs(title = "Ideal Surf Conditions Wave vs Wind")

surfIdeal %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = wind_speed, y = wave_height))+
  geom_bin2d()+
  labs(title = "Density Plot of Ideal Surf Conditions")

surfIdeal %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = wind_direction, y = wave_height))+
  geom_point(size = .5)+
  labs(title = "Ideal surf conditions Wave vs Wind Direction")

```

plot relationship between wind speed and wave size
```{r full data wind vs wave}
ggplot(data = wavewind, mapping = aes(x = wind_speed, y = wave_height))+
  geom_point(size = .1)+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title = "Wind Speed vs. Wave Height")

```

plot wave height based on wind direction , 245 is parallel
```{r wave height based on wind direction}
wavewind %>%
  select(wind_direction)%>%
  summarise(min = min(wind_direction), mean = mean(wind_direction), max = max(wind_direction))

ggplot(data = wavewind, mapping = aes(x = wind_direction, y = wave_height))+
  geom_point(size = .1)+
  geom_smooth()+
  labs(title = "Wind Direction vs. Wave Height")

```

graph monthly averages of wave height and wind speed
```{r monthly averages}
lake %>%
    select(date_time, month_date, year_date, wave_height, wind_speed)%>%
    filter(wave_height >=0 & wave_height < 30, wind_speed >= 0 & wind_speed < 100)%>%
    group_by(month_date)%>%
    summarise(waveH = mean(wave_height), windS = mean(wind_speed))

    # Doing the same thing with already filtered subset 
wavewind %>%
  select(date_time, month_date, year_date, wave_height, wind_speed)%>%
  group_by(month_date)%>%
  summarise(waveH = mean(wave_height), windS = mean(wind_speed))%>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = month_date, y = waveH))+
    geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
    labs(title = "Monthly Average Wave Height")

```

Graph by month and year, missing data makes it less pretty.
```{r by month and year}
byMonthYear <- lake %>%
  select(date_time, month_date, year_date, wave_height, wind_speed)%>%
  filter(wave_height >=0 & wave_height < 30, wind_speed >= 0 & wind_speed < 100)%>%
  group_by(month_date, year_date)%>%
  summarise(waveH = mean(wave_height), windS = mean(wind_speed))

byMonthYear %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = month_date,label=TRUE, abbr=TRUE, y = waveH, colour = year_date),
         group=factor(year_date))+
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Month", y = "Wave Height")+
  theme_classic()
```

Here is a crazy graph of what I was really tring to do. I couldn't figure out how to get the averages of each year.
```{r Incorrect month by year graph}
lake %>%
  select(date_time, month_date, year_date, wave_height, wind_speed)%>%
  filter(wave_height >=0 & wave_height < 30, wind_speed >= 0 & wind_speed < 100)%>%
  group_by(month_date, year_date)%>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(month(date_time, label=TRUE, abbr=TRUE), 
     group=factor(year(date_time)), y = yearmon(wave_height), colour=factor(year(date_time)))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Month", y = "Wave Height", colour="Year") +
  theme_classic()

```
