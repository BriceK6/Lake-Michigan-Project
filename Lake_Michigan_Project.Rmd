Graph by month and year, missing data makes it less pretty.
```{r by month and year}

  summarise(waveH = mean(wave_height), windS = mean(wind_speed))

byMonthYear %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = month_date,label=TRUE, abbr=TRUE, y = waveH, colour = year_date),
         group=factor(year_date))+
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Yearly Monthly Wave Height Averages", x="Month", y = "Wave Height")+

  #by wind

Here is a crazy graph of what I was really trying to do. I couldn't figure out how to get the averages of each year.
```{r Incorrect month by year graph}

  filter(wave_height >=0 & wave_height < 30, wind_speed >= 0 & wind_speed < 100)%>%
  group_by(month_date, year_date)%>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(month(date_time, label=TRUE, abbr=TRUE), 
     group=factor(year(date_time)), y = wave_height, colour=factor(year(date_time)))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Month", y = "Wave Height", colour="Year") +
  theme_classic()

#Focusing on wind data for kiting

Here are "ideal" surfing conditions for somewhere like Maui or California. These condititions are very rare in Michigan. We take any waves.
```{r ideal surfing conditions}

            maxWave = max(wave_height), meanWind = mean(wind_speed),
            minWind = min(wind_speed), maxWind = max(wind_speed), count =  count(surfIdeal))

Ideal conditions for beginner kiters
```{r ideal kiting conditions}

kiteIdeal %>%

```

Closing conclusions:
- Wind speed and wave height have a positive correlation
- Wind speed and wave height are both higher in the fall
- There seems to be a pattern between wind direction and wave height possibly due to the fetch of the lake
      - "The maximum length of open water that wind can travel across"
- Most surfing occurs in the fall but those rare occasions of Maui like conditions may occur more frequently in the summer
- Most kiting also occurs in the fall, but for beginners who need a decent amount of wind without too many waves, the summer is the best time to learn.
